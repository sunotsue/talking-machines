Welcome to "Talking Machines by Su Park," the podcast where we talk machines, the bots, and the hottest AI papers off the press, to demystify the world of artificial intelligence research!!! I'm Vic, and with me today is my lovely co-host, Alex.

Today, we’re diving into a fascinating paper titled "On the Biology of a Large Language Model." It’s like a backstage pass to the inner workings of Claude 3.5 Haiku, Anthropic’s latest lightweight production model.

Oh wow, that title sounds like it could be a biology class or a sci-fi movie!

Right? But the paper aims to reverse-engineer the internal mechanisms of these large language models. You know, the ones that seem to have impressive capabilities but often act like a black box. The researchers want to shed light on how these models work, especially since they’re being deployed in more and more applications. 

That’s wild! So, they’re basically trying to figure out what’s happening under the hood, right?

Exactly! Just like biologists use tools to understand living organisms, the authors are using a circuit tracing methodology to map out the features and interactions inside the model. They compare it to how cells are complex systems shaped by billions of years of evolution.
